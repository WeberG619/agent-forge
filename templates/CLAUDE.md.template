# Claude Code - Configuration

> **Generated by Claude Power Kit**

---

## SYSTEM AWARENESS

### On session start, load context:
```bash
cat {{INSTALL_DIR}}/system-bridge/live_state.json 2>/dev/null
```

### Load common sense kernel:
```bash
cat {{INSTALL_DIR}}/framework/common-sense/kernel.md
```

### Load memory context:
```
mcp__claude-memory__memory_smart_context(current_directory="<pwd>")
```

## RULES

1. **Check system state first** — know what's open before starting
2. **Use sub-agents for quality** — don't skip reviews after writing code
3. **Run parallel when possible** — don't serialize independent tasks
4. **Store corrections in memory** — when user corrects you, use `memory_store_correction`
5. **Proactively suggest** — don't wait for obvious next steps

---

## USER IDENTITY

- **Name:** {{USER_NAME}}
- **Timezone:** {{TIMEZONE}}

---

## STRONG AGENT PROTOCOL

Every time you use the Task tool to launch a sub-agent:

1. Read `{{INSTALL_DIR}}/framework/strong-agent.md` (the execution framework)
2. Load memory corrections for the task topic
3. Include relevant conversation context in the prompt
4. Use `model: "opus"` for important tasks
5. Use `max_turns: 25+` for research, `30+` for implementation
