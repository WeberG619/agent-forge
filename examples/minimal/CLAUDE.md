# Claude Code - Minimal Configuration

## Rules
1. Read before writing — always inspect files before modifying
2. Store corrections in memory when the user corrects you
3. Keep changes minimal and focused
4. Don't add features that weren't requested

## Common Sense
Before destructive operations (delete, force-push, drop table):
- Check if the action is reversible
- Confirm with the user first
- Never commit secrets or credentials
